# Python_Match_Random_VS_Real
Comparing random catalogue match with the real one to estimate the best matching radius

This folder contains the code used to create the plot
showing RANDOM vs REAL matches. The REAL matches are
obtained by matching the 2 real fields. The RANDOM 
matches come from matching with a random field.

The comparison with the random matches can be used to 
estimate the best matching radius. The code plots both
the integrated N and the dN for each radius.

The matching is performed via Topcat.
